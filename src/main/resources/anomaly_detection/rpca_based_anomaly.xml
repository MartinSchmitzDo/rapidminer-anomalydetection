        <title>Detect Outlier (Clustering)</title>
        <synopsis>This operator is allows you to use cluster based methods for anomaly detection. It currently supports
            CBLOF, CMGOS and LDCOF
        </synopsis>
        <text>
            <paragraph>Computes a robust PCA-based anomaly score. For robustness, trimming of the
                original data set based on the Mahalanobis distance is performed first. Then,
                PCA is computed and a score is determined based on the top upper and/or lower PCs.
                This operator follows the papers "A Novel Anomaly Detection Scheme Based on
                Principal Component Classifier" by Shyu et al (2003) and "Robust Methods for
                Unsupervised PCA-based Anomaly Detection" by Kwitt et al. (2006). In contrast to
                the original publications, this operator computes a normalized score instead of
                classifying into normal/anomalous instances.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>
                Please be aware of the fact that this method can deal with "one big" cluster only and will
                probably fail if normal data consists of multiple clusters (non-linear dependencies) as
                well as on local anomaly detection tasks.
